The contract explicitly includes a \"time is of the essence\" clause, which establishes that timely delivery is a material term of the agreement. The supplier's delivery on May 28 was 13 days late, exceeding the 7-day grace period specified in the contract for permissible delays. This delay constitutes a clear breach of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the supplier's notification on May 10 about logistical delays and the offer of a 5 percent discount does not absolve them of their contractual obligations. The client did not agree to modify the terms of the contract or waive their rights under the \"time is of the essence\" clause. Therefore, the supplier remains liable for the late delivery.\n\nThe client also suffered damages as a direct result of the breach, specifically a 3-day shutdown of operations. These damages are foreseeable and directly tied to the supplier's failure to deliver the critical parts on time. Under contract law, the client is entitled to seek compensation for these losses.\n\nIn summary, the supplier breached the contract by failing to deliver within the agreed timeframe, and the client has a strong claim for damages resulting from the delay.", "sources": [{"filename": "sample_case.txt", "snippet": "ase Summary: Delivery Contract Dispute The client entered a delivery agreement requiring shipment of critical parts by May 15.
