description: Review an implementation, code change, pull request, or deployed design against linked use cases, approved ADDs, C4 views, accepted ADRs, quality attributes, and GDPR/EU AI Act safeguards. Use when checking architecture compliance, identifying undocumented drift, assessing whether diagrams/docs need updates, or producing an Architecture Conformance Review (ACR); do not use it to approve or rewrite decisions automatically.

# Review Architecture Conformance

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, the change diff/code/tests/configuration, and all linked architecture artifacts.
2. Determine the authoritative baseline: reviewed/approved use cases, approved ADD content, accepted ADRs, and applicable current/target C4 views. Proposed artifacts are advisory only.
3. Build a requirement-to-evidence matrix using [references/review-method.md](references/review-method.md).
4. Inspect responsibilities, dependencies, interfaces, data flows, trust boundaries, deployment, failure modes, logging, oversight, and test evidence.
5. Classify each variance as `Conformant`, `Documented deviation`, `Undocumented drift`, `Artifact stale`, or `Not verifiable`.
6. Report findings by severity with exact code/artifact references and a concrete remediation. Do not modify code unless separately requested and authorized.
7. Create `architecture/reviews/ACR-NNN-<slug>.md` when the user requests a persistent review; otherwise return the review in chat.

## Rules

- Do not treat an accepted ADR as proof that implementation conforms.
- Do not treat current code as authority that silently overrides an accepted decision.
- Recommend a new/superseding ADR when reality requires a decision change.
- Recommend artifact updates when implementation is correct but documentation is stale.
- Verify privacy-safe logs, data minimization, retention/deletion, transparency, traceability, and human oversight where applicable.
- Never expose personal/health data, secrets, credentials, or sensitive operational values in findings.
- Never claim approval; identify required owners and decision points.

## Output

Lead with overall result and blocking findings. Include baseline artifacts, evidence matrix, findings with severity, compliance assessment, required artifact/code changes, unverifiable items, and recommended owner/action.
